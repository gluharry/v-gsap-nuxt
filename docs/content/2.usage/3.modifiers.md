# Modifiers

Discover all the different features of `v-gsap`.

## `.from`, `.to`, `.fromTo`, `.call`

V-GSAP supports the above four main animation types.

- `.from` animates from a given state to its current state
- `.to` animates from the current state to a given to-state
- `.fromTo` combines both the above. It takes an Array of two states as value
- `.call` takes an arrow function as value and executes it
  - when used with `.whenVisible.`, it will automatically be handled like
    `.once.`

---

## `.whenVisible`

[See in Action](/playground#whenvisible)

- enables scrollTrigger. It defaults to from `top 90%` to `top 50%` and `scrub`
- you can overwrite these properties in the value Object. In combination with
  `.fromTo`, put the overrides in the second state

### `.fromInvisible`

- Adds `opacity: 0` as initial state and includes `opacity: 1` in `.to` or
  `.fromTo`.
- This prevents the element from being visible until the directive takes action.
  Especially needed for above-the-fold animations
- With this modifier you can create entrance animations without always repeating
  the opacity hassle.

### `.once`

Makes the animation play only once when scrolling down, and stay in its final
state even when scrolling back up.

### `.once.reversible`

Similar to `.once` but will reverse the animation when scrolling back up,
allowing it to play again when scrolling down.

::alert{type="info"} This is the default previous behavior of `.once`. ::

### `.markers`

Adds markers for debugging.

### Custom Scroller

If your content is wrapped in an artificial scroll container, use
`{ [...], scroller: '<selector>' }` as a selector string inside the value object
to override the default scroll container. ::alert{type="info"} Note: You can
also set this globally in the `nuxt.config.ts`
[See details](/installation/configuration) ::

---

## `.onState-<key>-<value>`

The `.onState-` feature allows to play certain animations only when a
data-attribute has a certain value.

The modifier consists of 2 or 3 parts:

`.onState-<key>-<value>`

- `key`: refers to the data attribute that is used as source. Example: key
  `test` would refer to `data-test=""`
- `value`: (optional) the target value to trigger the animation.
  - If left out, the desired target value is `true`. This allows more readable
    syntax like `.onState-open`

Example:

```typescript
<div
  :data-index="someIndexVar"
  v-gsap.onState-index-2.to="{ ... }"></div>
```

The above example code would run the animation when the `data-index` value is
`2`

This feature uses `MutationObserver` in the background that updates each time
the given data-attribute changes. If the current value equals the target value,
the animation is played. If the values don't match, the animation is reversed.

### .inherit

This is a submodifier for `.onState-` and allows the data-attribute to be on
some parent. This is useful if you want to update multiple child elements based
on some parent state.

In the background `el.closest()` is used to search for a parent that has the
matching data-attribute.

Simple example:

```typescript
<div :data-index="someIndexVar">
  <div v-gsap.onState-index-2.inherit.to="{ ... }"></div>
</div>
```

## `.parallax`

[See in Action](/playground#parallax)

- enables parallax effect for this element. Brings its own scrollTrigger,
  therefore doesn't need extra `.whenVisible.`.
- Only works with a speed settings like:

### `.slower-<integer>`

### `.faster-<integer>`

Element scrolls slower or faster than the default scroll speed.

- The value is a multiplier of 10% element height. E.g. `.slower-5` scrolls the
  element from +-50% to +-50% height.
- If the value is left out, default is `5`. Meaning: `.slower` defaults to
  `.slower-5` (same with faster)

---

## `.stagger`

[See in Action](/playground#stagger)

enables stagger for immediate children if placed on the parent. Duration can be
overwritten in the value object.

---

## `.infinitely`

[See in Action](/playground#infinitely)

This sets the repeat of the timeline to `-1` to infinitely repeat the animation

---

## `.delay-<milliseconds>`

[See in Action](/playground#delay)

- can be added to delay the action for n milliseconds like `.delay-500.`
- any integer value will be accepted, like `.delay-1234.`

::callout{type="warning"} #summary Note: Only works with `whenVisible` if used
with `once`

#content Since `whenVisible` is specifically timed via `start` and `end`, a
delay only squeezes the actual animation towards `end`.

With `.whenVisible.once`, the animation is no longer "timed" but "triggered",
therefore `.delay-` makes sense again ::

---

## `.whileHover`

[See in Action](/playground#whilehover)

lets you define a hover animation. By default, it reverses on leave.

### `.noReverse`

can be used to disable the reversing on leave

---

## `.draggable`

[See in Action](/playground#draggable)

Allows the element to be draggable

### `.x`, `.y`, `.rotation`

allows to restrict the direction of the drag.

### `.bounds`

restricts the container.

- If left empty (`.draggable.bounds`) it restricts the parent.
- A querySelector can be passed

```ts
v-gsap.draggable.bounds="'.someContainer'"
```

---

## `.animateText.`

[See in Action](/playground#animatetext)

Animates Text letter by letter

- It can either take a string as value like

```ts
v-gsap.animateText="'Das ist ein Text'"
```

- Or if no value is given, it takes the inner textContent from the element

```ts
<div v-gsap.animateText> Inner Text </div>
```

### `.slow`, `.fast`

Changes the typing speed

---

## `.magnetic`

[See in Action](/playground#magnetic)

Makes an element be magnetically attracted to the cursor

### `.weak`, `.weaker`, `.stronger`, `.strong`

Modifies the strength of attraction. ::alert{type="info"} Order: weak <- weaker
<- **default (none)** -> stronger -> strong ::

---

## `.mobile`

## `.desktop`

[See in Action](/playground#desktop)

With these you can specify the viewport on which the animation shall take place.

- Window resizing is handled automatically.
- Breakpoint is `768px`
- You can combine both. Simply use both `v-gsap.mobile.` AND `v-gsap.desktop.`
  on the same element.

---

## `.preset`

[See in Action](/playground#preset)

You can define presets in `nuxt.config.ts` to make animations reusable.

[See details](/usage/presets)

---

## `.entrance`

This is similar to `.preset`, but focuses on predefined entrance animations.
There are the following options out of the box:

- `.slide-left`
  - Slides and fades in from left
- `.slide-right`
  - Slides and fades in from right
- `.slide-top`
  - Slides and fades in from top
- `.slide-bottom`
  - Slides and fades in from bottom
- `.fade`
  - Simply fades in
- `.scale`
  - Fades and scales in from 75% size
- `.scale-full`
  - Fades and scales in from 0% size

::alert{type="info"} 
Note: `.entrance` uses `.whenVisible.once` under the hood.

`.once` is needed to ensure animations run through even if scrollTrigger start
is passed (e.g. in a hero section)
